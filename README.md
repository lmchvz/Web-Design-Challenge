## Web Design Challenge - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

### Project Description: 
The goal of the project was to create a website that utilizes HTML and CSS skills to create a visualization dashboard that includes a landing page, data page, visualization pages, comparisonson pages and a navigation menu.  

The visualization dashboard analyzes how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.

After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude. Factors we looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed.

### Tools Used:

- CSS 
- Bootstrap
